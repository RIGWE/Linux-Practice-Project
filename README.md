## Cat Command

Also Known as `Concatenate`, the cat commend Is one of the most frequently used Linux Commands. its functions are: `Lists`, `combines` and `writes` file content to the standard output.

Creating a File

## mkdir Command

mkdir known as `make directory` is a command used to create one or multiple directories at once while setting permissions for each of them.  

The Basic syntax is `mkdir [option] directory_name`

For example

## locate Command

The locate command is used to find a file in the database system. In addition, adding the -i argument turns off case sensitivity, so a file can be searched even without knowing its exat name.

locate customer
